This sketch uses a MERG kit 50 block detector to sense the presence of a locomotive on the stretch of track with the level crossing on it. 

Once it is triggered the bells will sound and the 4 leds will flash. A few seconds later the 2 servos will lower the barrier arms.. once the train leaves the stretch of track the arms will raise and then the sound and leds will stop. Awaiting the next trigger.
